# Fetchchimp

A Wordpress plugin that augments *Autochimp* to pull data from Mailchimp. Supports *Cimy Extra Fields* field mappings as set in *Autochimp*. Currently at a very early stage of development but operational, bugs aside. Better docs will be provided as development progresses.

The idea is that you set a CRON job to trigger an import by hitting the url `/fetchchimp/trigger`

## Roadmap

* Lock trigger down to IP
